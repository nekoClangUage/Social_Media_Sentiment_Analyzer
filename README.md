# Social Media Sentiment Analyzer

This is a model-based ML approach to analysing social media post sentiments.  

Modules used were: Scikit-learn (Machine Learning), Pandas (for .csv files), re (regex), NLTK (text preprocessing).  

Original Data were taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kashishparmar02/social-media-sentiments-analysis-dataset/data.

Also this repository contains temporary results (sentimentdataset_sentimentsChanged.csv; preprocessed_text_and_sentiments.csv)
Original dataset has the following name: "sentimentdataset.csv"




***IMPORTANT:*** I deleted metadata information from main.ipynb. So, if you want to see intermediate results (output), you should run the script.
